## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Redis

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Postman
- Docker
- Docker Compose

---

## ⚙️ Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/backendverse/spring-boot-redis-pub-sub
   cd spring-boot-redis-pub-sub
   ```
---

## 🐳 Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

If you don’t want to install Redis manually, you can use **Docker Compose**.

### 1️⃣ Start Redis Container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2️⃣ Verify Container is Running

```bash
docker ps
```

👉 You should see a container named **redis**.

### 3️⃣ Connect to Redis CLI inside the Container

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
redis-cli
```

✅ Now you are inside Redis! 🎉

### 4️⃣ Subscribe to Topics using Pattern Subscriber

```bash
PSUBSCRIBE live*
```

👉 Example: `live*` → will subscribe to all channels like **`live-news`**, **`live-sports`**, **`live-weather`**.

### 5️⃣ Publish Data to a Topic

```bash
PUBLISH live-sports "Latest Update: Cricket is awesome!"
```

⚡ Here, **`live-sports` is your CHANNEL name** — you can replace it with any channel (e.g., `live-news`, `live-weather`).

## 🔗 Example APIs

### 1️⃣ Publish Message
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/notification?message=Breaking%20News%20and%20todays%20sports'
````
